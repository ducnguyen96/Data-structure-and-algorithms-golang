## Recursion ?
- A function calls itself.
- Can occur stack over flow

## Advantage
- DRY
- Readability

## Disadvantage
- Large stack

## When to use
Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.

- Divided into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
- Each instance of the sub-problem is identical in nature.
- The solutions of each sub-problem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Tree Traversal
